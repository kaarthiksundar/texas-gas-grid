Codes to parse the Gas Pipeline network in the Texas Gas Grid case in "https://electricgrids.engr.tamu.edu/7k-electric-gas/"

The code also performs some clean up of the data. To run the code use ``python src/main.py --help``. This will show
the command line arguments available. Just running ``python src/main.py`` should provide a successful run and save 
the log file to ``logs/`` and the output file in the directory ``output/``.
